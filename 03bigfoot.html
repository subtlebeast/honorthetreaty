    Can you imagine the heart of Big Foot when the Seventh Cavalry found them and huddled them there? The children clinging to the women? The young men angry? Everyone scared? The rolling up of those big guns on wheels. The shouted commands? The dangerous, defiant looks of the young men?

    Can you imagine the moment of the blast? Pregnant women shot through, exploding their bellies onto the snow? The bodies of little boys. Can you imagine Big Foot, who tried, a chief of the Miniconjou, son of Lone Horn, a Lakota, one of the tribes of the Seven Council Fires, cut down, left <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DeadBigfoot.jpg">dead and rigid in the snow</a> for days?
