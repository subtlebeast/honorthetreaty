            The Lakota first met the whites in 1804, when Lewis and Clark led a party of them into camp that September. The whites gave the Lakota medals with the picture of the President on them. They explained that the President was their “great father” to the east, and that he owned all these lands. The Lakota were confused. The two men explained that the great father had purchased their lands from the French.

            There were buffalo to the horizon when Red Cloud was born. The Lakota then were a proud and powerful people. A warrior tribe of nomadic hunters, of horse-masters, they wandered freely, establishing moveable villages with their tipis.
          </p> 

          <p>
            It was an organic life, determined by the seasons. In the summer, they met with the six other tribes of their nation. Together, these tribes formed the Oceti Sakowin, the Seven Council Fires, and they engaged in the sun dance, the most sacred of <a href="http://aktalakota.stjo.org/site/PageServer?pagename=alm_culture_rites">their seven traditions</a>. And that was the way of the world. The Crows were their enemies; the Cheyennes were their friends. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakan_Tanka">Wakan Tanka</a> governed all.

            Though we know them as the Sioux, they are not the Sioux. [“Sioux” is <a href="http://www.lakotacountrytimes.com/news/2009-03-12/guest/021.html">what the French called them</a> after hearing the Chippewa, their enemies to the east, refer to them as the Nadowesioux, or little snakes.] They are the seven tribes of the Oceti Sakowin, “the Seven Council Fires.” 
          </p>  

          <p>
            The Lakota are the westernmost of the Oceti Sakowin. Together with the Yanktons, Yanktonais, Sissetons, Mdewakantons, Wahpetons, and Wahpekutes, they form a great nation united in the shared language of Lakota or, in the dialect of the central and eastern tribes, Nakota and Dakota.

            The Lakota are divided into seven bands: the Sihisapas, the Miniconjous, the Hunkpapas, the Sans Arcs, the Brulés, the Two Kettles, and the Oglalas.

              It was 1849, but the Lakota didn’t know that. They didn’t measure time that way. Nor did they know of California and the irresistible pull of its gold. What they did know was that, suddenly, there were many whites in their lands. Disturbing the buffalo. Bringing disease.

            The whites’ travel through their lands was disrupting things. In addition to deaths caused by cholera, measles, and the other diseases that they carried, the presence of the whites was upsetting the buffalo. The Lakota could not tolerate this. They began to get restless. To keep them from getting hostile, the whites called a <a href="http://www.wyohistory.org/essays/horse-creek-treaty">big meeting</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            For two weeks, the whites entertained thousands of American Indians at the mouth of the Horse Creek in Wyoming. They gave them food, weapons, and utensils. They also passed around a paper and asked that it be signed. The Indians, who couldn’t read, trusted the whites and “touched the pen.” By this, they understood that they would be given annual payments of money in exchange for removing themselves to a big land where the whites would let them be.

              After the council at <a href="#09">Horse Creek</a>, there was a time of peace - until, like in 1849, the whites once again found gold. This time it was in Montana. John Bozeman blazed a trail to get there. This trail went through prime buffalo hunting ground.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Lakota started bothering the whites, who built forts to protect the trail. Red Cloud emerged. He said, dismantle the forts and abandon the trail.

            Red Cloud and his warriors harassed the forts mercilessly. This annoyed Captain William Fetterman, who boasted, “[w]ith 80 men, I could ride through the whole Sioux Nation.” [<em><a href="http://www.historynet.com/the-falsehoods-of-fettermans-fight.htm">But see</a></em>.] On December 21, 1866, Captain Fetterman rode out of Fort Kearney with 80 men.

            Despite the Lakota’s victory in the Fetterman Fight, they were to struggle against certain disadvantages that they were never able to overcome. One of these was technological. 
          </p> 

          <p>
            In the summer of 1867, for example, Red Cloud attacked a party of 32 soldiers just outside of Fort Kearney. Having a much larger force, Red Cloud’s victory should have been swift. Instead, the soldiers huddled in a wagon box and repelled Red Cloud’s initial charge. Expecting that the defenders would need time to reload, Red Cloud sent in another assault. Impossibly, these attackers were also mowed down. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Red Cloud didn’t know that the garrison at Fort Kearney had recently been issued new breech-loading Springfield rifles, which greatly diminished reloading times. 
          </p>

          </p>

          <p>
            Red Cloud ordered repeated attacks and each one was successfully turned aside. Baffled, Red Cloud eventually withdrew. 
          </p> 
          
          <p> 
            But he kept harassing the forts.

            Aside from being outmatched technologically, the Lakota faced many other hurdles. Perhaps most importantly, they were outnumbered. They also were hampered in their field movements by having to worry about the weak and the elderly. 
          </p>  
          
          <p>
            Finally, they didn’t understand the whites’ way of war. What Robert Utley described as the "unremitting" nature of it. There was a type of balance to their endless struggle with their traditional enemies like the Crows. These enemies fought for honor, for disputed territory, for reprisal. They fought with a sense of proportion. Neither side was intent upon the other’s utter annihilation.

            Fighting Red Cloud was costly. Also, it was slowing the progress of the railroad which, in the period of reconstruction following the Civil War, the country desperately wanted to complete. So, the whites approached Red Cloud and said, let us build the railroad and we will abandon the forts along the Bozeman Trail. In fact, we will set aside the Black Hills, which are sacred to you, for the “absolute and undisturbed use” of the Lakota. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The Lakota agreed.
          </p>

          <p>
            The railroad was completed in 1869.

            Shortly after signing the 1868 treaty, Red Cloud was invited to Washington and New York. He was amazed by the magnitude of these cities. “Now we are melting like snow on the hillside,” he said, “while you are growing like spring grass.”

              Half convinced and half compelled, the Indians move away to dwell in new deserts where the whites will not allow them to live ten years in peace. Thus it is that Americans acquired for next to nothing whole provinces the richest monarchs of Europe could not afford to buy.

            Under the terms of the 1868 treaty, Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer shouldn’t have gone snooping around the Lakota’s Black Hills looking for gold, but he did anyway. In 1874, he found it. He wrote letters east encouraging white expansion into the Hills and, in violation of the treaty, whites once again swarmed the Lakota’s land.
          </p> 

          <p>
            The next year, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs commented in his annual report on “the utter impracticality of keeping Americans out of a country where gold is known to exist by any fear of orders or of United States cavalry, or by any consideration of the rights of others.”
