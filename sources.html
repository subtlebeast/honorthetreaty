The removal and relocation of Indians also contributed to the collapse, but probably only in a small way. The collapse was so severe that by 1800 the total American Indian population had been reduced to 600,000 from 5+ million in three centuries. Meanwhile, the non-Indian population of the United States had increased to over 5 million.").</p>

This is sometimes called an unanswerable question that historians nevertheless must try to answer. There is sadly little clear information about populations to be found in historic records or archaeological evidence. Even careful estimates differ widely, as they are based largely on assumptions. For America north of Mexico around 1491, these estimates range from perhaps 1.8 million people to more than 18 million—a difference of ten times. More recent population figures are clearer. Many historians believe that the Native population of the United States reached its lowest point—about 250,000—at the end of the 19th century. By the end of the 20th century, the population had rebounded to 4.1 million. National data from the 2010 U.S. census have not yet been published.")</p>

("Lewis and Clark distributed national medals (a tradition among French and British traders) and wrapped a newborn baby in an American flag, symbolically conferring American citizenship on the Sioux infant. Such friendly acts neither tempered Lewis's opinion of the Tetons, 'the vilest miscreants of the savage race,' nor brought home to the Sioux the full portent of the explorers' visit. They could not fathom that a man named Thomas Jefferson had bought the entire Sioux domain, and much more, for three million dollars, or that (under the white man's 'doctrine of discovery') their homeland was previously owned by Napoleon. The Sioux knew who controlled every bluff and creekbed from the Platte River to the Yellowstone — and it was neither a president nor an emperor.").

            There were buffalo to the horizon when Sitting Bull was born. The Lakota then were a proud and powerful people. A warrior tribe of nomadic hunters, they wandered freely, establishing moveable villages with their tipis.
          </p> 

          <p>
            It was an organic life. In the summer, they met with the six other tribes of their nation. Together, these tribes formed the Oceti Sakowin, the Seven Council Fires, and they engaged in the sun dance, the most sacred of <a href="http://aktalakota.stjo.org/site/PageServer?pagename=alm_culture_rites">their seven traditions</a>. That was the way of the world. The Crow were their enemies; the Cheyenne were their friends. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wakan_Tanka">Wakan Tanka</a> governed all.

              It was 1849, but the Lakota didn’t know that. They didn’t measure time that way. Nor did they know of California and the irresistible pull of its gold. What they did know was that, suddenly, there were many whites in their lands. Disturbing the buffalo. Bringing disease.

<!--             The whites’ travel through their lands was disrupting things. In addition to deaths caused by cholera, measles, and the other diseases that they carried, the presence of the whites was upsetting the buffalo. The Lakota could not tolerate this. They began to get restless. To keep them from getting hostile, the whites called a <a href="http://www.wyohistory.org/essays/horse-creek-treaty">big meeting</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
            For two weeks, the whites entertained thousands of American Indians at the mouth of the Horse Creek in Wyoming. They gave them food, weapons, and utensils. They also passed around a paper and asked that it be signed. The Indians, who couldn’t read, trusted the whites and “touched the pen.” By this, they understood that they would be given annual payments of money in exchange for removing themselves to a big land where the whites would let them be.

That country was then the very cream of the buffalo range - and the buffalo furnished everything required by the Indian in the way of food, clothing and skins for lodges - which was all he desired for his welfare and happiness.").

        <article>
          <p>
            Despite the Lakota’s victory in the Fetterman Fight, they were to struggle against certain disadvantages that they were never able to overcome. One of these was technological. 
          </p> 

          <p>
            In the summer of 1867, for example, Red Cloud attacked a party of 32 soldiers just outside of Fort Kearney. Having a much larger force, Red Cloud’s victory should have been swift. Instead, the soldiers huddled in a wagon box and repelled Red Cloud’s initial charge. Expecting that the defenders would need time to reload, Red Cloud sent in another assault. Impossibly, these attackers were also mowed down. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Red Cloud didn’t know that the garrison at Fort Kearney had recently been issued new breech-loading Springfield rifles, which greatly diminished reloading times. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Red Cloud ordered repeated attacks and each one was successfully turned aside. Baffled, Red Cloud eventually withdrew. 
          </p> 
          
          <p> 
            But he kept harassing the forts.

The details of battlefield movements, even of individual deeds, blurred in the shadow of the honor roll. When pressed, they would talk about their battles with the white soldiers, but they plainly preferred to recall the glories of war with enemy tribes. That was real war, war understood by both sides, war that conferred honor and prestige without threatening tribal survival. That threat came from the white people. They fought a different kind of war, a serious unremitting war not confined to the battlefield, one that the Sioux never really understood.").

These orders were to be enforced 'quietly,' and the President's decision was to remain 'confidential.'").
          </p>
<!-- 
          <p>
            Grant then probably turned to an advisor and said, what do you think? You’ve read the treaty. Is there any way around it?
          </p>

          <p>
            And the advisor said, the treaty’s pretty clear, Mr. President. It guarantees the Black Hills to those Indians. We've tried to get them to amend it, but Article XII stipulates that the treaty can’t be amended “unless executed and signed by at least three-fourths of all the adult male Indians,” and we’ve only gotten 10% of them to sign.
          </p>

          <p> 
            And then Sheridan said, look here, that damned treaty’s put the Army in an impossible position. Those flowery letters of Custer's have re-kindled gold fever in the country. Our people want those hills. Do you really expect us to keep arresting Americans for entering land that ought to be there’s anyway? And why? Because we made a deal with a bunch of natives who can't even read the paper they “signed”? That’s ridiculous.

          <p>
            Okay then, said Grant, stop arresting the prospectors. Let them through. We won’t break the treaty, we just won’t enforce it. The Indians will be forced to attack. When they do, we’ll treat it as an act of war.

          <!-- <p>
            In the summer of 1876, Custer, who the Lakota referred to as “Long Hair,” led the 7th Cavalry out of Fort Abraham Lincoln in search of Indians to force onto a reservation outside of the Black Hills. On June 25, he found a village camped by the Little Big Horn River and attacked it. A numerically superior force of Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapahos under the leadership of Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse countered. The outnumbered soldiers panicked. Before long, a Lakota woman named Julia Face recalled, “the Indians acted just like they were driving buffalo to a good place where they could be easily slaughtered.”  Custer and his entire command of over 200 men were killed.
          </p>

          <p>
            After the battle, two Cheyenne women found Long Hair’s body and drove sticks through his ears. Kate Bighead, a Cheyenne woman who witnessed the battle, said, “this was done to improve his hearing, as it seemed he had not heard what our chiefs in the South had said when he smoked the pipe with them. They told him then that if ever afterward he should break that peace promise and should fight the Cheyennes, the Everywhere Spirit surely would cause him to be killed.”

            In 1877, the United States presented the Lakota with a new treaty that divested them of ownership of the Black Hills in exchange for food and support from the federal government. Only ten percent of the Lakota, including Red Cloud, signed this treaty. This new treaty was therefore legally unenforceable, as it didn't meet the requirement of Article XII in the 1868 treaty that any new agreement be "executed and signed by at least three-fourths of all the adult male Indians.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Nonetheless, the Lakota were forced from the Black Hills.

            Can you blame Red Cloud for signing the treaty of 1877? Without the buffalo, the Lakota were going to starve. The whites said they would give them rations. Teach them how to farm. The Lakota didn’t want to learn how to farm. They were hunters. But Red Cloud saw the inevitable. He had been to Washington. He had been to New York. He had seen the numbers of the white men. He had seen their technology. He knew that the Lakota could not win this fight. And so, he signed the treaty and surrendered the Black Hills. It was not for nothing. He was not a traitor. He got what he could. Who can blame him?

He didn’t want to be rooted. He said: “The life of white men is slavery. They are prisoners in towns or farms. The life my people want is a life of freedom. I have seen nothing that a white man has, houses or railways or clothing or food, that is as good as the right to move in the open country.”

            <em> See also id </em> at p. 122 ("The pattern of land loss established during the period 1887 - 1934 continues to this day. A survey of the four largest reservations in Montana illustrates the scope of this loss ... Tribes in Montana lost 5,332,317 of their original 11,631,407 acres. Over 80 percent of the best allotted land in Montana ended up in the hands of non-Indians.").

          <!-- <p>
            You ask us who owns the land? We say that’s a ridiculous question. The land is part of the whole. It is the land, and we are the people of the land, and these are the buffalo and the eagles, and these are the waters and the rocks. Each thing fits in its place in the tapestry that is the community of the earth.
          </p>

          <p>
            No. All this business of sharing things, this overly-developed sense of tribal community that you people have, it must stop. It’s frustrating your assimilation. We believe in private property. In ownership. And so shall you. There is no more “tribal land”; there is land that is yours, and land that is not yours. Thus, the reservation will be divided. Each family will given 160 acres, which that family will work. Beyond those acres, you own nothing. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawes_Act">This legislation</a> will be “a mighty pulverizing engine for breaking up the tribal mass.” Also, after these allotments, there will be a good deal of reservation land left over. That land now belongs to us.

      <!-- <section id="35">35. The Ghost Dance</section>
        <article>
          <p>
            The Lakota, of course, have never lost hope, and they’ve never given up. But that period following the passage of the Dawes Act, when the buffalo were gone, the Lakota way of life was being dismantled, what little land they had left was being halved, and even Sitting Bull himself had come south to surrender onto the reservations, must have been among the saddest and most unendurable in all of the history of this country’s indigenous peoples.
          </p> 

          <p>
            During this desperate time, word began to spread about a Pauite Indian named Wovoka who preached a new religion known as the Ghost Dance. Many Lakotas, including Big Foot, latched on to the Ghost Dance as a way to restore the tribe to its past glory. Other Lakotas, like Red Cloud, predicted that open celebration of the Ghost Dance would upset the whites, who were trying to make the Lakotas conform to western society. Still others, like Sitting Bull, supported the Ghost Dance but did not participate.
          </p>

          <p>
            As Red Cloud feared, the whites became nervous that the Ghost Dance would lead to an uprising among the Oceti Sakowin. Thinking that Sitting Bull was encouraging the practice, they issued a warrant for his arrest. During the execution of that warrant, Sitting Bull was killed. Fearing further violence, Miniconjou Chief Big Foot led his followers south from Sitting Bull’s Standing Rock reservation to Pine Ridge, where he hoped to find protection with Red Cloud. On December 29, 1890, the 7th Cavalry intercepted them at a creek called Wounded Knee.

            </p>

            <p>
              Right near the flag of truce a mother was shot down with her infant; the child not knowing that its mother was dead was still nursing, and that especially was a very sad sight. The women as they were fleeing with their babes were killed together, shot right through, and the women who were very heavy with child were also killed ... [A]fter most all of them had been killed a cry was made that all those who were not killed or wounded should come forth and they would be safe. Little boys who were not wounded came out of their places of refuge, and as soon as they came in sight a number of soldiers surrounded them and butchered them there.

              Of course we all feel very sad about this affair. I stood very loyal to the government all through those troublesome days, and believing so much in the government and being so loyal to it, my disappointment was very strong, and I have come to Washington with a great blame on my heart. Of course it would have been all right if only the men were killed; we would feel almost grateful for it. But the fact of the killing of the women, and more especially the killing of the young boys and girls who are to go to make up the future strength of the Indian people, is the saddest part of the whole affair and we feel it very sorely."

              "The gun consists of five barrels, grouped around a common axis, which are revolved around a solid immovable breech-block. This has in one part an opening to introduce the cartridges, and another opening through which to extract the empty shells, whilst the cartridges are discharged singly … The turning of a crank causes the automatic loading, firing, and extraction of the empty cartridge-cases, all these operations being performed continuously during the movement of the crank.

              This machine-gun has, besides its great accuracy and range, the peculiar and valuable advantage of firing explosive shells, producing the greatest moral and physical damage to the enemy, and enabling at the same time to rectify its fire by observing the explosions of falling projectiles."

            Wounded Knee wasn’t the end of the Lakota, but it was the end of their hopes that the whites would ever leave them alone or let them return to their old ways. Instead of the physical and military-style resistance exemplified by Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, the Lakota transitioned to the approach modeled by Red Cloud and Spotted Tail, who worked within the confines of the white system to preserve what they could of the Lakota way of life. Red Cloud said, “we looked forward with hope to the time when we would be as independent as the whites and have a voice in the government.” 
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1923, the Lakota did what Americans do when they’ve been denied a voice in the government. They filed a lawsuit.

            Although the practice of the institutionalized killing of indigenous people stopped in the twentieth century, the taking of their land did not. What was true for the Lakota was true for all of the indigenous tribes. In 1887, when the Dawes Act was passed, the total amount of tribal land in the United States was 138 million acres. By 1934, that number had fallen to 52 million.

            Fifty years after they filed their lawsuit, the Lakota still had won no relief on their Black Hills claim.

          <p>
            Frustrated with the pace of the lawsuit and the impoverished conditions on the reservations, a militant group known as the American Indian Movement gained support among the Pine Ridge Oglalas. 
          </p>

          <p>
            On February 27, 1973, Lakotas under the leadership of AIM members like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVANRroxuOo">Russell Means</a>, seized the town of Wounded Knee and demanded that the United States agree to the establishment of an independent Oglala Nation based upon the terms of the 1868 treaty. With support from high-profile personalities like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QUacU0I4yU">Marlon Brando</a>, the siege lasted for over two months, during which time the federal government blockaded the town and killed two of the siege members. A federal agent was also shot and paralyzed by the occupiers. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In the end, the Lakota agreed to abandon the siege, their conditions having been unmet.
