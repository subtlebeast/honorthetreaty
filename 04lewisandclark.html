    The Lakota first met the whites in 1804. Two men led a party of strangely-dressed people into a Lakota camp that September. The men gave the Lakota medals with the image of a man on them and then they gave odd news. They said that the man on the medal was the great father to the east. They said the great father owned all these lands. The Lakota didnâ€™t understand. The men explained that the great father had purchased these lands from the French.
